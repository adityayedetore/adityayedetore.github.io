I am a graduate student in  the Linguistics Department at Boston University, working with [Professor Najoung Kim](https://najoungkim.github.io). I am interested in semantics, syntax, and language acquisition.

Previously I was an undergraduate student in the Cognitive Science Department at Johns Hopkins University. I did research with [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net), [Bob Frank](https://bobfrank1.github.io), and [Tom McCoy](https://rtmccoy.com) studying language acquisition through simulation with deep learning models. I also did research with [Justin Halberda](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/justin-halberda/) and [Nico Arlotti](https://www.nicolocesanaarlotti.com) on the interface between our visual system and the meanings of "All" and "Each".
