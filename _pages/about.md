I am currently a graduate student in  the Linguistics Department at Boston University, working under [Professor Najoung Kim](https://najoungkim.github.io). I am interested how meanings are represented in the mind, and the consequences of that representational format for downstream processing.

Previously I was an undergraduate student in the Cognitive Science Department at Johns Hopkins University. I did research working with [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net), [Bob Franke](https://bobfrank1.github.io), and [Tom McCoy](https://rtmccoy.com) relating the language acquisition capactities of deep learning models to those of humans. I also did reasearch with [Justin Halberda](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/justin-halberda/) and [Nico Arlotti](https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/justin-halberda/) on the inferface between our visual system and the meanings of "All" and "Each".
